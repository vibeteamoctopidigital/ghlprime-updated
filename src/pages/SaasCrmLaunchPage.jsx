      `GoHighLevel SaaS mode setup is the process of turning your GoHighLevel agency account into a true software business where clients sign up, get billed automatically, and receive their own white-labeled CRM sub-account without you touching anything manually. SaaS mode is the feature that connects Stripe, sets your rebilling markup on phone, email, and AI usage, and provisions accounts from a snapshot the moment a payment clears.`,
      `The platform gives you the engine, but the configuration is where most agencies stall. Rebilling has to be margined correctly, plans need clean pricing tiers, and snapshots must be productized so every new customer lands in a working CRM, not an empty shell. We pair this launch with [ongoing white-label client support](/services/white-label-support) and a [dedicated SaaS customer support](/services/saas-customer-support) team so your users get help under your brand from day one.`,
      `If your roadmap goes past what native SaaS mode can do a custom signup flow, usage dashboard, or a feature GoHighLevel does not ship our [custom SaaS development](/services/custom-saas-development) team builds the missing layer. Want a real number on margin and timeline? [Book a free call](/booking) and we will map your plans, pricing, and provisioning live.`,

  faqs: [
    { q: 'What is GoHighLevel SaaS mode and what do I actually sell?', a: 'SaaS mode lets you resell GoHighLevel as your own white-labeled software. Customers sign up, get billed through Stripe, and receive their own branded CRM sub-account automatically. You sell a monthly software subscription instead of services. With rebilling, you also mark up usage like calls, texts, and AI on top of your plan price.' },
    { q: 'How does rebilling work and how do I make a profit?', a: 'Rebilling lets you charge customers more than your platform cost for phone, email, and AI usage typically a 1.4x to 4x markup. We set your wallet, margin, and plan pricing so every subscription and every unit of usage earns. Done right, agency clients commonly report a 30% revenue lift within 90 days of launching.' },
    { q: 'How long does it take to launch a SaaS CRM?', a: 'Most launches go live in 3 to 4 weeks. Week one is strategy, pricing, and building your productized snapshot. The rest covers Stripe and SaaS mode configuration, white-label branding, your custom domain, and full end-to-end testing of signups, provisioning, and billing before you go public.' },
    { q: 'Will my customers know GoHighLevel or GHL Prime is behind it?', a: 'No. We apply your logo, colors, login page, and a custom domain across the entire app, so the product looks completely like yours. Our work is fully white-labeled. If you add our support team, your users get help under your brand and never learn GoHighLevel or GHL Prime is involved.' },
    { q: 'What if I need features beyond what native SaaS mode offers?', a: 'SaaS mode covers billing, plans, and provisioning, but some roadmaps need more a custom signup flow, a usage dashboard, or a feature GoHighLevel does not ship. Our custom SaaS development team builds that layer on top of your account so you are never blocked by the platform ceiling.' },
    { q: 'How much does a SaaS CRM launch cost?', a: 'GHL Prime works on project-based and retainer models with no setup fees and no contracts. Most launches are scoped and priced on your strategy call once we know your plan tiers and snapshot scope. You can also hire our team through our Upwork agency profile if you prefer billing that way.' },
