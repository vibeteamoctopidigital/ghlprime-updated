      `Web and mobile app development is the process of designing, building, and deploying digital applications a native iOS or Android app users download from the App Store, a web application they open in a browser, or a cross-platform app that runs everywhere from a single codebase. GHL Prime is a web and mobile app development agency that builds all three, using React Native and Flutter for mobile and Next.js with Supabase for web.`,
      `The global mobile app market reached $197.2 billion in 2025, with over 6.8 billion smartphone users and 81% of businesses now requiring mobile applications. Most agencies still move slowly and hand you a codebase you do not understand. We build differently using [vibe coding workflows](/services/vibe-coding) with Claude Code and Cursor to ship production-ready apps 3–5x faster, without cutting corners on quality, security, or performance.`,
      `Whether you need an iOS app for your coaching business, an Android companion for your SaaS, or a web dashboard for your clients, we scope the build, pick the right stack, and deliver it phase by phase. Because we are also a GoHighLevel specialist team, we connect your app to your [GoHighLevel CRM](/services/ghl-setup) and can add [AI agents for your app](/services/ai-agent-builder) or [book a free consultation](/booking) to map it out.`,

  faqs: [
    { q: 'What types of apps does GHL Prime build?', a: 'GHL Prime builds iOS apps, Android apps, cross-platform mobile apps, web applications, SaaS products, and client portals. We use React Native and Flutter for mobile, and Next.js with Supabase for web applications. Every build is production-ready and delivered with deployment documentation.' },
    { q: 'How long does it take to build a mobile app?', a: 'An MVP mobile app typically takes 2–4 weeks depending on complexity. A full-featured app with auth, payments, push notifications, and API integrations usually takes 4–8 weeks. We deliver in phases so you see working software weekly, not just at the end.' },
    { q: 'Do you build for both iOS and Android?', a: 'Yes. Using React Native or Flutter, we build a single codebase that runs natively on both iOS and Android. This approach cuts development time and cost significantly compared to building two separate native apps while delivering a native-quality experience on both platforms.' },
    { q: 'Can GHL Prime submit my app to the App Store and Google Play?', a: 'Yes. We handle the full App Store and Google Play submission process app signing, metadata, screenshots, and review submission. We also handle any rejection responses and resubmissions until your app is live on both stores.' },
    { q: 'How much does it cost to build a custom app with GHL Prime?', a: 'GHL Prime offers project-based, hourly, and retainer pricing with no setup fees and no contracts. App development costs depend on features, platforms, and integrations. We scope and price every project on a free discovery call before any work begins. You can also hire via our Upwork agency profile.' },
    { q: 'What is the difference between a web app and a mobile app?', a: 'A web app runs in a browser and is accessed via URL no download required. A mobile app is installed from the App Store or Google Play and can access native features like camera, GPS, push notifications, and biometric authentication. GHL Prime builds both, and can also build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that bridge the gap.' },
    { q: 'Do you integrate apps with GoHighLevel?', a: 'Yes. Many clients need their mobile or web app to connect with their GoHighLevel CRM syncing leads, triggering workflows, updating contacts, or pulling reporting data. We build these integrations using the GHL API and webhooks so your app and your CRM stay in sync automatically.' },
