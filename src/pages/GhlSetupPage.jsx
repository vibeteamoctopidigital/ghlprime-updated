      `GoHighLevel setup and configuration is the work of turning a blank or broken GHL account into a system your business can actually run on. That means sub-account architecture, pipelines and opportunity stages, calendars, A2P 10DLC registration, Twilio and email/domain authentication, reusable snapshots, and clean data migration. Done wrong, it leaks leads and tanks deliverability; done right, every lead lands in the right pipeline and every message gets delivered.`,
      `Most people who try to set up GoHighLevel alone get stuck on the parts that matter most A2P 10DLC compliance, domain authentication, and pipeline logic that mirrors how they actually sell. We handle the full build, then connect it to the rest of your stack with [GoHighLevel automation](/services/automation) so the system runs itself, and we can layer on [AI agents and conversational bots](/services/ai-agent-builder) once the foundation is solid.`,
      `Whether you are launching a brand-new account or untangling one another vendor left broken, we configure it to standard and document everything. If you also need a productized platform for your own clients, our [SaaS CRM build-out](/services/saas-crm) extends the same foundation. Want a clean account without the trial and error? [Book a free consultation](/booking) and we will audit your setup, scope the work, and give you a realistic timeline on the call.`,

  faqs: [
    { q: 'How long does a full GoHighLevel setup and configuration take?', a: 'Most full setups take 1 to 2 weeks, depending on scope. A single sub-account with pipelines, calendars, and compliance is often live in under a week. The longest variable is A2P 10DLC approval, which is carrier-controlled and can take a few business days. We give you a firm timeline on your discovery call.' },
    { q: 'What is A2P 10DLC and do I really need it for GoHighLevel?', a: 'A2P 10DLC is the carrier registration required to send business SMS in the US. Without it, your texts are throttled or silently fail to deliver. It is the single most common reason a GoHighLevel account underperforms. We register your brand and campaigns, connect Twilio, and confirm your messages are landing before handoff.' },
    { q: 'Can you fix a messy GoHighLevel account instead of starting over?', a: 'Yes. We start with an audit of your existing account, identify what is broken failing SMS, tangled pipelines, bad deliverability and rebuild the foundation without losing your data. Across 100+ accounts, most messes come from skipped compliance and pipeline logic that never matched the real sales process.' },
    { q: 'Will I lose data migrating from another CRM to GoHighLevel?', a: 'No. We migrate contacts, conversation history, tags, and pipeline data from HubSpot, Keap, or any legacy CRM with zero data loss. We map your old fields to GoHighLevel, run a test import, verify it, then complete the full migration so you move over once, cleanly, with no downtime.' },
    { q: 'Do you build reusable snapshots so I can launch new accounts faster?', a: 'Yes. We package your configuration into clean, versioned snapshots so launching a new sub-account takes minutes instead of days. This is essential for agencies onboarding clients at volume. One approved build becomes your repeatable standard across every future GoHighLevel account.' },
    { q: 'How much does GoHighLevel setup and configuration cost?', a: 'GHL Prime works on project-based and hourly models with no setup fees and no contracts. A single-account build is priced differently from a multi-account agency rollout with a custom snapshot. Most setups are scoped and quoted on your free discovery call, so you know the cost before any work begins.' },
